# HiddenInfoTrade_FHE

A privacy-focused, on-chain strategy game leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for hidden information trading. HiddenInfoTrade_FHE allows players to anonymously and securely exchange confidential game state information, enabling true strategic competition and intelligence-driven gameplay.

## Project Overview

Strategy games often rely on hidden information, but on traditional platforms, trading or revealing this information can compromise player privacy:

- **Exposure risk**: Revealing hidden cards, resources, or moves can disadvantage players.  
- **Limited trust**: Players may not trust opponents or the platform with sensitive in-game data.  
- **Strategic complexity**: Trading hidden information is essential for bluffing, alliances, and espionage.  

HiddenInfoTrade_FHE enables encrypted trading and computation over private game states using FHE. Players can buy, sell, and analyze hidden information without ever revealing it to other players or the platform.

## Key Features

### Encrypted Information Trading

- **FHE-based transactions**: Compute outcomes of trades and strategies directly on encrypted data.  
- **Anonymous player interactions**: Players trade hidden information without exposing identities.  
- **Secure marketplace**: Buy, sell, or barter confidential game insights safely.  
- **Strategic intelligence**: Evaluate hidden information while maintaining full privacy.

### Privacy & Security

- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**: All computations occur on encrypted game states.  
- **Immutable trade logs**: Secure record of trades without revealing private information.  
- **Role-based access**: Only authorized in-game operations can affect encrypted data.  
- **Encrypted analytics**: Assess strategic value of hidden information without decryption.

### Gameplay & Mechanics

- **Hidden state management**: Track private resources, positions, and plans securely.  
- **Strategic trading**: Exchange insights or intelligence with other players on-chain.  
- **Decision support**: Use encrypted analysis to optimize moves, alliances, and strategies.  
- **Dynamic leaderboard**: Rankings derived from encrypted outcomes without exposing player secrets.
